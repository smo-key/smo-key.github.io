Today in AP Computer Science, we watched two TED Talks found [here][td1] and [here][td2].  The first was a photosynthesis program which I found neither unique, nor exciting as there are already many exisiting algorithms to merge images together (including my favorite, [hyperlapse][hyperlapse]).  The second was a desciption of the internet as chewable, mashable hardware, connected by intercontinential wires spanning the entire globe.

I was bored, and the natural go-to for bored "crypto-maniacs" like me is [xkcd][xkcd-wi].  Therefore, I discovered a new idea.  Here it is.

##What if a squirrel turned off the internet?
(based on Andrew Baum's "What is the internet really?")

First, there would be the problem of depositing the squirrel near the fiberoptic cables at the bottom of the sea. Second, once the squirrel has located the wires, there would be the problem of masking them as an edible treat.  Finally, the squirrel in question must destroy every fiberoptic cable connecting Europe, America, and virtually every other continent in the globe.

It would be much easier just to train a whale.
