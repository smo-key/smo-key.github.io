Over the past six weeks, I have learned much about the analog level of digital circuits.  We began the year with basic resistive circuits, learning about basic elements of resistance, current, and the generalities of Ohm's Law.  While that section was interesting for me, I was waiting for the day when I would get a breadboard, Arduino, oscilloscope, and start playing with circuits.  

I was not disappointed.  Soon, we began onto more complicated circuits, equivalent resistance, but most important: the Arduino software.  I had used an Arduino at a 6-week camp at a local university, Southerwestern, to help build a modern automaton out of servos and piezo elements.  Today, I finally got a chance to use this device again.  Soon, I hope to begin developing circuits to attach to my Raspberry Pi (which is hosting half of the site you are reading right now), and to begin my journey as a future engineer.
