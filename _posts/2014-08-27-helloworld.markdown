I've never done a blog post before.  So, being a programmer and all, "Hello World!", or for the more `--traditional` programmers out there, "hello, world".

Just to reiterate: I have absolutely no idea what I am doing.

(This blog is for an AP Computer Science course at LASA and I honestly hope that no one is actually reading it.  If you are, good for you!  Otherwise, move along, nothing to see here.)
