This week, we worked on several labs, none of which were interesting.  To make the process of compiling and recompiling Java JARs more interesting, I wrote a quick library to aid in the infinite annoyances of switching from C to Java.  The library is called Dose (pronounced Dohse), which stands for the Ecstatically Smart Output Doubler and is available open source on [Github][Github], with the rest of the labs I wrote.

The idea of finding something interesting to do was my greatest challenge.  I guess that, until I can find a more interesting challenge, that this one is good enough.  :)
